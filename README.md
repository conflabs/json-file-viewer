# json-file-viewer
A simple app to display text files containing JSON data in a machine readable format.

## Getting Started

- Place JSON files in the `storage/json` folder.
- View in a browser at `http://localhost/fileName.json`, where `fileName` is the name of the file you want to view.

## Notes:

- Web Server is currently configured for Apache.
- Web Server requires write permissions for everything in the `storage/` folder.
